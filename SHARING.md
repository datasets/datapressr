# DataPressr

**Turn raw data finds into published datasets — fast, with AI.**

The goal: go from "interesting data thing" to a polished, published entry on DataHub in under 10 minutes. No more half-finished tabs and good intentions.

## Where We Are

We're at the end of Stage 1: the posting loop exists, on paper and in practice.

**Done:**

- **Plan** — a clear, staged approach: backlog first, manual posts next, automation only after we feel the friction
- **Backlog** — 100+ dataset candidates imported from the Data Commons issue tracker, plus a live inbox for new finds
- **Data model docs** — defined the data hierarchy, lifecycle, and a catalog-as-repo pattern (with EH.net as a concrete example)
- **Dashboard candidates** — an initial list of data stories worth building

**Next:** publish the first post manually. Pick one item, fill the template, commit, ship.

The insight driving this: don't design the system before you've felt the workflow. Ten manual posts will teach more than ten hours of architecture.
