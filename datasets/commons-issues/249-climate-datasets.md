@rgieseke it would be great to get your assistance here as i know you are something of an expert. If you have any suggestions please let us know 😄 

## Research

* We have several core datasets on this already - TODO list.
* http://github.com/openclimatedata

## TODO

Merge here existing notes and work on this from core registry repo: https://github.com/datasets/registry/issues/124

Not aware of much outside of what's already in core datasets or what I've been packaging in *openclimatedata*. 
Are you also looking for data to package?

On https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ there is some CC-licensed data available at the download "arrow" in the top right.

### rufuspollock (2018-01-02T14:20:46Z)

@rgieseke that's great. It would be great to reference the stuff at openclimatedata.

Note for awesome pages the datasets don't have to be data packages (but nice if they are).

Would you be up for writing a brief summary of what you know from your experiences?

### rgieseke (2018-01-08T09:13:42Z)

Happy to provide some links and give input, but it's a large field ...

### rufuspollock (2018-01-09T17:42:05Z)

@rgieseke great - any initial thoughts you have would be great.

Here are some more collected:

SSP Database (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) - Version 1.1

The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project

ISIMIP offers a framework for consistently projecting the impacts of climate change across affected sectors and spatial scales. An international network of climate-impact modellers contribute to a comprehensive and consistent picture of the world under different climate-change scenarios.

The Data saving efforts also may be useful starting points:

@rgieseke thanks and which from the openclimatedata do you recommend (some i know are data packages and some are just code).

### rgieseke (2018-01-09T19:44:02Z)

@rufuspollock All that are tagged `data-package` could be useful in climate policy analysis

The INDC and NDC packages are filtered with the most relevant single document in 'nationally-determined-contributions'.

### rgieseke (2018-01-10T16:26:59Z)

This earlier thread has also lots of datasets

https://discuss.okfn.org/t/climate-change-datasets/1593/7

### rufuspollock (2018-01-15T18:42:22Z)

@rgieseke really useful - i've started stubbing something based on discuss.okfn.org post here http://datahub.io/awesome#climate-change

Please jump in and add your datasets https://github.com/datahq/awesome-data/edit/master/README.md (and I can too but you probably know better than me so i can follow your lead)
