# [discuss] UNESCO stats database

This is not a specific dataset but an entire database. Classic multi-dimensional cube. A lot of the data series seem sparse.

The interface seems pretty horrible though some network inspecting did yield some promising leads see e.g. https://gist.github.com/rgrp/842db702c60633d86a66
