# Merge old econdata into core data

From 2005-2009 I worked on the Open Economics project at Open Knowledge and accumulated various datasets:

https://github.com/okfn/econ/tree/master/econdata

We should merge all of these into here.

@Mikanebu could you add a link to **where** they are published

### Mikanebu (2017-11-07T10:34:58Z)

@rufuspollock I updated issue itself with links next to dataset

### rufuspollock (2017-11-07T10:41:23Z)

@Mikanebu ok, but please can you paste them when you comment too - that saves me having to scroll around.
