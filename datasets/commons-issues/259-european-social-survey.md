@rufuspollock has downloaded a copy and needs to upload it to datahub

## Openness: Closed (non-commercial, sign-up)

Have to sign up to download (not a biggie though!)

They do keep mentioning non-commercial use only but i can't see a formal license (and i didn't have to sign anything or agree to anything when signing up).
