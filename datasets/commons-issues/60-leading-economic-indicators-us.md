Federal reserve economic data - http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/
Can export data as .xls e.g. http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPIAUCSL/

There are many sources like Fed, IMF, World Bank. Should one of these be trusted or should all be provided. Someone who works with this kind of data (economist) can probably weigh in on the relative merits. Although a lot of data seems easily accessible i am not sure about how easy it will be to write scrapers that update the data at specific intervals.

@sanh2o first thing is probably to do research on LEIs (I know the standard are the conference board for US but they seem proprietary now!)
