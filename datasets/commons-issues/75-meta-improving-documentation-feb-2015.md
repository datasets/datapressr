# [meta] Improving Documentation (Feb 2015)

This is a generic issue for collecting items re better documentation and workflow

Once we have clear issues and/or recommendations we should probably open an issue on https://github.com/okfn/data.okfn.org/issues and then fix. Relevant issues:
- [super] Publishing data tutorials / patterns - https://github.com/okfn/data.okfn.org/issues/91
- Publishing FAQ - https://github.com/okfn/data.okfn.org/issues/154

@ekoner asked in #71 
1. I've named the file sic-2007-condensed.csv - does this meet naming conventions and where can I find these?
   - **We do not have these and we should add them to (new) http://data.okfn.org/doc/publish-faq**
2. Title - Again, is there a naming convention for this? I've gone with "UK condensed standard industrial classification of economic activities (SIC) 2007 codes"
   - **Ditto**
3. Name - Same as title? Abbreviated? I've used "UK Condensed SIC 2007"
   - **See http://data.okfn.org/doc/publish-faq (which has guidance here)**
4. License - Can't select or type in, so I'm assuming it goes somewhere else.
   - **This is now fixed in http://data.okfn.org/tools/create** /cc @sxren

We need better instructions re license application and recording source license info - see e.g. #35 discussion

This looks like it has been fixed. For file naming and licensing issues, look at http://data.okfn.org/doc/publish-faq
