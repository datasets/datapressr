Started work (but very incomplete - e.g. no data): https://github.com/datasets/co2-ppm

Reference: https://github.com/datasets/co2-fossil-global

Packaged.

@sxren perfect - can you link the data package github repo here - then we'll close.

### sxren (2015-01-11T16:20:56Z)

The data package github repo can be found at https://github.com/datasets/co2-ppm.

Hmm. There isn't a `Close issue` button next to the `Comment` button. Maybe I don't have permission to close the issue.

FIXED.

@sxren I've made you admin on this repo so you'll now see the close button too! Welcome to being a Core Data "Queue Manager" :-)

@sxren live at http://data.okfn.org/data/core/co2-ppm

BTW: one last comment - I think title could be sharpened a bit to exclude acronym's like ESRL. I'd go for something like: "CO2 PPM - Concentration of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Over Time"

@rgrp wow! very cool. thank you.
