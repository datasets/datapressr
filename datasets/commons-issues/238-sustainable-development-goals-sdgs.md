# Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

UN home page: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/

When we say SDGs we could mean two things:

* Indicators - https://github.com/datasets/registry/issues/197
* Data on performance

We are interested in both there.

SDG indicators is a core dataset under development here: https://github.com/datasets/registry/issues/197

I think it will be worth creating a dedicated page on this as imagine a bunch of stuff on this .

@rufuspollock  I'm going after this. I'll download it from the specified [website](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list) and it will look like:

```
Goals and targets, Indicators, UNSD Indicator Codes
string, string, string
NaN, string, string
```

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/otruja/sdg-indicators). Review and recommendations for further wrangling needed!

@otruja great! I've opened issues on the data repo itself for now.
