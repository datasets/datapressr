@mcnabber091 this seems very useful. Do you want to start prepping it?

### rufuspollock (2015-08-01T09:58:47Z)

@mcnabber091 do you need help prepping? (and do you get notifications when i "@" you?)

### mcnabber091 (2015-08-01T23:00:03Z)

Thanks Rufus, I will start  prepping for this statistic sometime this weekend. I don't get notifications when you '@' me.

@mcnabber091 if you go to your settings in github you should be able to configure it so that you get emails on e.g. @ messages (or issues you are involved with). I suggest doing that as it mean you don't miss out on things.
