  * Counts and BMI averages

## Research

I think there is data on this in WHO non communicable diseases (NCD) report e.g. here is 2018:

https://www.who.int/nmh/publications/ncd-profiles-2018/en/ (cached copy [9789241514620-eng.pdf](https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/files/4238746/9789241514620-eng.pdf))

Wikipedia page: "List of countries by body mass index" (based on WHO NCD 2014 report)
