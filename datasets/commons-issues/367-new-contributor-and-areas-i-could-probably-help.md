# New Contributor and areas I could probably help

While updating financial models I found a link to issue #171 talking about economic indicators links to inflation.md which has two subsequent links that are now generating `Error 404` when I clicked https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/blob/master/core/inflation and https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/blob/master/core/cpi-us

Do we need to fix the links or should they be pointed to https://datahub.io/docs/core-data?
Annual inflation by GDP deflator and consumer prices: [core/inflation](https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/blob/master/core/inflation)
US Consumer Price Index and Inflation (CPI): [core/cpi-us](https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/blob/master/core/cpi-us)

My background is drafting documents, testing specifications, financial analysis and risk assessment when I moved into finance. Its only been in the last half decade that I've been learning python, R, .rst and docker for Natural Language Processing, I'm happy to commit to about 10 hours a month improving code and expand methods to curate data. I'll read the https://datahub.io/docs/core-data/curators-guide this week.

@datatalking it looks like #171 is quite an old issue (2016) and the links must have changed etc. Currently, this is the page which contains a summary of economic indicators: https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/blob/master/economic-data.md  which also has a number of broken (404) links. As a start, you could raise a PR to fix the links, e.g., this https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/blob/master/core/gdp has been moved to its own repo here https://github.com/datasets/gdp. I think it is similar to most of the links.

@datatalking also, we have the board where you can overview issues statuses and see where contribution is needed: https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/projects/1
