@anuveyatsu i want to contribute and resolve this opened issue

### anuveyatsu (2022-08-18T13:58:38Z)

@geoffrey1330 sure, please go ahead 👍

### anuveyatsu (2022-08-18T14:01:23Z)

@geoffrey1330 sorry, could you hold on? I need to check why this issue is in "published" pipeline. Could you clarify @monikappv if you remember 😄

### geoffrey1330 (2022-08-18T14:23:33Z)

OK

### geoffrey1330 (2022-08-23T12:15:31Z)

@anuveyatsu have you made the inquiries why the issue is in "published"?. if so can i move forward with the contribution and resolving the issue?

Hi @geoffrey1330 it has been already wrangled but not yet published on GitHub site. It is publicly available on GitLab here: https://gitlab.com/robgrootjen/malaria-death

so there is no need to work on this item.

### geoffrey1330 (2022-08-24T06:38:30Z)

Alright thanks @anuveyatsu for the feedback.

This is needs to be copied over to github.com/datasets (don't even need to fork - can just copy and paste the content)
