# Missing values in data csv files

GitHub complains about missing data to render the CSVs in `data`:

"It looks like row 71 should actually have 4 columns, instead of 3."
https://github.com/datasets/registry/blob/master/data/catalog-list.csv#L71

"It looks like row 59 should actually have 4 columns, instead of 3." 
https://github.com/datasets/registry/blob/master/data/core-list.csv#L59

I think "owner" is missing ...
