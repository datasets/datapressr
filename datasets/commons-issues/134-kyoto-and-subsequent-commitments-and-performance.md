# Kyoto (and subsequent) commitments and performance

Part of #124 climate change datasets effort

This dataset should contain the specific commitments regarding GHG emissions and actions made by countries under Kyoto and subsequent meetings.

Kyoto protocol: http://unfccc.int/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/items/6034.php

From: http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/items/6036.php

> Puts the onus on developed countries to lead the way.

> The idea is that, as they are the source of most past and current greenhouse gas emissions, industrialized countries are expected to do the most to cut emissions on home ground. They are called Annex I countries and belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). They include 12 countries with "economies in transition" from Central and Eastern Europe. Annex I countries were expected by the year 2000 to reduce emissions to 1990 levels. Many of them have taken strong action to do so, and some have already succeeded.

> Directs new funds to climate change activities in developing countries.
> 
> Industrialized nations agree under the Convention to support climate change activities in developing countries by providing financial support for action on climate change-- above and beyond any financial assistance they already provide to these countries. A system of grants and loans has been set up through the Convention and is managed by the Global Environment Facility. Industrialized countries also agree to share technology with less-advanced nations.
