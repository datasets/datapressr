# Historical US House Prices

Available from Shiller's data page: http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm

Data file is xls: http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/Fig2-1.xls

Note we already have case-shiller index so perhaps this is not a core dataset (but nice to have)

I'll be taking a look at this one! How do you define which values to integrate? Everything in the source, then just clean and package, or is there a process to define which fields to have?

### rufuspollock (2015-02-06T09:24:03Z)

@andreaswpv i'd go for everything in the source by default - you can use your judgment here and check back in if queries.

### rufuspollock (2015-02-22T22:09:06Z)

@andreaswpv how are you doing? Instructions can be found at http://data.okfn.org/doc/publish

### andreaswpv (2015-02-25T03:26:34Z)

Right. Package is ready, but I think the data is copyright protected, so I cannot publish it.

### rufuspollock (2015-02-25T07:52:24Z)

@andreaswpv in general this kind of data will likely not get legal protection. I think we should go ahead and publish, if necessary explaining in the README where you think there are concerns.

### rufuspollock (2015-04-26T18:27:25Z)

@andreaswpv can you please share somewhere and we can take care of publishing as a core dataset if you are not happy there.

@rufuspollock I am working on this issue
