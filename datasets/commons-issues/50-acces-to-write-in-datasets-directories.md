# acces to write in datasets directories

Hi , can I have acces to add this datapackage  https://github.com/aliounedia/senegal-companies to the register ?

You can do a pull request. That said I was trying to keep the registry focused on what I was terming "core datasets": http://data.okfn.org/roadmap/core-datasets

I'd also like to start a registry of just all data packages (which this would obviously be).

So ...

What I suggest is that:
- We copy datapackage-list.txt to core-list.txt
- Add your datapackage to datapackage-list.txt and keep core-list for only core datasets

If you do this as a pull request i'll merge it in :-)

@aliounedia your data package is now in - see https://github.com/datasets/registry/blob/master/github-list.txt#L6
