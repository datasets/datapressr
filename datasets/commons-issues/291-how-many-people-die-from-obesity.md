# How many people die from obesity?

## Obesity death count.
I've been really interested in knowing how much people are actually dying from obesity which causes CHD(Chronic heart diseases). 

## Data sources
Here are some sources.

* Top 10 obese countries - https://www.valuewalk.com/2019/01/top-10-most-obese-countries-oecd-who/
* U.S.A dying rate obesity - https://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/oehp/obesity/mortality.htm#targetText=According%20to%20the%20National%20Institutes,the%20obesity%20epidemic%20(57).
