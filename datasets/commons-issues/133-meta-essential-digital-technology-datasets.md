# [meta] Essential Digital Technology Datasets

This is a meta issue for discussing key digital tech datasets that we might want as core.

Initial suggestions:
- Storage costs (hard disk / SSD / data center?) - cf https://github.com/rgrp/hard-drive-prices
- Transmission costs (cost per GB over the internet since inception)
- Processing costs (cost per GFlops or something)
- Size of the internet
- Total world computing power

From a friend: """Borden, _The Economic Effects of Advertising_ 1947 has adoption rates for fridges and if I remember right other appliances to that point in time.""", but not very helpful as a dataset
