# GLIDE number

http://glidenumber.net

It’s down at time of writing, and has experienced intermittent downtime of late. So mirroring it here (or somewhere) would be extremely useful.

> Accessing disaster information can be a time consuming and laborious task. Not only is data scattered but frequently identification of the disaster can be confusing in countries with many disaster events. To address both of these issues, **Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC)** proposed a globally common Unique ID code for disasters. This idea was shared and promoted by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) of the University of Louvain in Brussels (Belgium), OCHA/ReliefWeb, OCHA/FSCC, ISDR, UNDP, WMO, IFRC, OFDA-USAID, FAO, La Red and the World Bank and was jointly launched as a new initiative "GLIDE".

I’ve become unconvinced it’s sensible to duplicate this here! Sorry for the noise.

@andylolz i think this would be useful to package at some point so re-opening - it seems like a cool dataset :smile:

The site continues to be really patchy:

…so mirroring it could be useful.

The UN now republishes a subset of GLIDE numbers here:
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/unocha-glides

There’s some explanation of how this subset is determined:
https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/new-glide-number-source-available/1357/3

So historical and non-UN GLIDE numbers aren’t included in that mirror.

@andylolz i think this is worth packaging if you are up for it ...
