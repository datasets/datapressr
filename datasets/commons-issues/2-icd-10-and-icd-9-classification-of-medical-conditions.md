# ICD-10 and ICD-9 Classification of Medical Conditions

The WHO maintains a listing of known diseases at http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/ - the data download is only available upon registration and with a NC license. Is there an open version of this somewhere?

Not found an open version yet, but we could start with the original and state license as NC ...

@pudo Would you be happy to grab and data-package-ize?

I haven't agreed to any license, but is the data the same as [2015 Code Descriptions in Tabular Order ZIP, 1MB](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/Downloads/2015-code-descriptions.zip) from the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2015-ICD-10-CM-and-GEMs.html)?

@seansummers I'm not totally sure - could you do a quick compare? Also let's package up the 2015 Code Descriptions since we have them (and if they turn out to be the same all the better).

@seansummers did you have a chance to look at this?

### rufuspollock (2017-10-21T08:00:35Z)

@Mikanebu could you start looking at this and checking with @AliNaqvi if this is already in JSL work?

### Mikanebu (2017-10-23T11:55:50Z)

@rufuspollock It is already in JSL datasets, but it is not on core offering.

### rufuspollock (2017-10-23T16:03:44Z)

@Mikanebu great - so we will have this covered in core!

### rufuspollock (2018-03-13T13:22:20Z)

@Mikanebu where is this on the DataHub and i think this should be in core.

### Mikanebu (2018-03-14T08:31:14Z)

@rufuspollock It has not published yet as I could not find on the DataHub, but it was on their list of datasets. We have to discuss it on Friday with JSL.
