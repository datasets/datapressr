# [topic] Climate Change datasets

What are the most important "general" datasets to have on climate change?

_Note: we are not looking for very detailed datasets for specialists. More the "general" datasets - the kind you would want if you were building a "dashboard" for intelligent policymakers and citizens._

Here are some examples to get started - more suggestions wanted.
## Policy
- [ ] Country or sub-region commitments (e.g. emission amounts, cuts, temperature targets)
- [ ] Which countries / regions have emission trading schemes in place and their status
- [x] #29 - CO2 "price" in ETS
## State of the World
- [ ] Temperature datasets - which ones?
  - [x] #48 Earth Temperature Time Series
- [ ] #27 - CO2 per country (what about other GHG)
- [ ] #125 - long-term CO2 PPM <del>#56 - CO2 PPM (over time)</del>
- [x] #29 - CO2 "price" in ETS
- [ ] #138 Arctic Sea Ice Volume
- [x] #139 Global Temperature Anomaly
- [ ] #142 Climate Change Impacts
- [x] #141 Global Sea Level Rise
- [ ] #144 Hurricane damages
- [ ] #145 Global Fire
- [ ] #146 Climate change and biodiversity
- [ ] #143 Population growth rate
- [ ] #147 Cleantech and renewables

See also #134 and #135

Adding: http://cait.wri.org/ - very good set of data from WRI.

### pdehaye (2015-12-10T22:45:20Z)

#29 is also relevant, and almost completed

http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/all-datasets - a whole bunch of climate related datasets. Not official source ...

Regarding this last source link  http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/TOP-20-emitter#tspQvChart
Some of datasets like TOP 20 emitters above are from official source > World bank

Mentioning here  #138,  #139, #141, #142, #143, #144, #145, #146, #147, so this thread gets pinged in each.

Hi,
I've packaged Paris Agreement Entry Into Force status here:
https://github.com/openclimatedata/paris-agreement-entry-into-force

Another one is the Global Carbon Budget:
https://github.com/openclimatedata/global-carbon-budget
This contains CO2 emissions data from CDIAC but also extensions of it and other sources.

@rgieseke that's brilliant - and also know you are welcome to contribute to any "core datasets" items 😄
