# Dataset of Global News Organizations

@rgrp would a dataset of global news organizations be something you would include here? Do you have any / know of anyone else procuring such datasets?

If you don't have one @shidash and I will work collecting some soon, so leave this issue open for later inclusion!

This is a great idea! Let's put it together.

### rufuspollock (2015-04-26T18:24:31Z)

@bnvk any further thoughts?

### bnvk (2015-04-27T14:23:06Z)

@rgrp yah here are the values I'm thinking should be in included in such a dataset. Feel free to add any other things you're thinking of.

```
- Name of Org
- Public URL
- RSS feed
- Size of Org
- Location
- Topic (general publication, business, specific topic)
- Twitter Account
- Subscriber Size
```

I've yet to do any scrapping to create the dataset, but will probably do so in the near-ish future!

@bnvk seems a great set of fields. Look forward to seeing the scrape results :_0

@bnvk let us know how this is going!

### bnvk (2015-07-07T13:45:36Z)

@rgrp sadly, I have not made much progress of late as more immediate needs keep coming up. It's still in the backlog que though ;)

Another option would be to use hand curated Twitter lists from the organisation @reportedly. Most of the lists are curated for newspapers and journalists by country, but some are a bit different. In fact, taking the reportedly lists and exporting that as datapackages might be useful.
