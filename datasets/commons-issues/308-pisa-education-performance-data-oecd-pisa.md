# PISA Education Performance data - OECD PISA

PISA is OECD's "Program for International Student Assessment" https://www.oecd.org/pisa/. PISA measures 15-year-olds’ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges.

It is special because it is one of the few (maybe the only) cross-country standardized tests of student skills in core areas like mathematics and reading. It started in 2000 and is done every 3 years and is still running as of today.

TODO: there is a bunch of work here to dig out the data as it is split by cohort and then in multiple files ... e.g. https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/database-pisa2000.htm
