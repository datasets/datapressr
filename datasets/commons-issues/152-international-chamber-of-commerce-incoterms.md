# International Chamber of Commerce Incoterms

International Commercial Terms (‘Incoterms’) are internationally recognised standard trade terms used in sales contracts. They’re used to make sure buyer and seller know:
- who is responsible for the cost of transporting the goods, including insurance, taxes and duties
- where the goods should be picked up from and transported to 
- who is responsible for the goods at each step during transportation
