GitHub badge in each repository containing datapackage will be a great idea.

One badge could be a link to a DataPackage viewer http://data.okfn.org/tools/view?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdatasets%2Fregistry

An other bagde could show if data are «valid» or not, pointing to service  such as https://goodtables.io/

Ideally a GitHub bot could read core registry and submit automatically Pull Requests to several repositories containing DataPackage

@scls19fr glad you like the proposal and nice additional suggestions. Now we just have to wait until we have time to work on this or someone volunteers 😄

Maybe you should try to find an affordable freelance graphist....

A badge for «valid» data seems to exist
see for example
https://goodtables.io/github/vitorbaptista/birmingham_schools/jobs/15

Maybe datasets/registry should be checked using goodtables and this badge be added
