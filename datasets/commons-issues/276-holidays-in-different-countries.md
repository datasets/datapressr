# Dataset for Holidays in Different countries

The dataset I am going to collect 
* [ ] https://github.com/gadael/icsdb For US and some other countries 

For Global: Data is too much!


## Research
Question: 
 * For a specific country or Global
 * Holidays that don't have a set date 

### US
https://github.com/gadael/icsdb - Open repository of static calendar ICS files for "non-working days". Does not have a lot yet. Belgium (1 file), France (9 files), Germany (19 files), Ireland (1 file), Switzerland (27 files), United-Kingdom (3 files), United-States (51 files)(already mentioned in the issues)
 * Good collection for some countries like US, Germanay and Switzerland

### Global
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_holidays_by_country - Wikipedia has good collection of public holidays for almost all the countries
  * But the data for each country is in a seperate link 
  * The structure of available is a bit inconsistent.Some are in tabular form some arent. 

* https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/
  * Data available according to dates but all of it is in different links

* https://www.infoplease.com/calendar-holidays/major-holidays/national-holidays-around-world
  * The following table lists the date and name for select national holidays in countries around the world. Independence, revolution, flag, and founding days of more than 100 nations but more like a list of independence days rather than a list of holidays in different countries.

  * Also a potential

@rufuspollock @MuhammadIsmailShahzad should we consider existing work here that is done via "data concierge" on datahubio?
