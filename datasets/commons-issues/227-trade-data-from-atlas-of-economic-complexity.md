# Trade data from Atlas of Economic Complexity

2016 data: https://intl-atlas-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Our raw trade data comes from the United Nations COMTRADE database, a publicly available resource. Our research team - led by Sebastian Bustos, with key inputs from Muhammed Yıldırım and Ricardo Hausmann - apply a unique method to clean the trade data to account for inconsistent reporting practices and thereby generate estimates of trade flows between countries.
