@Snekili Following this link: http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/observed/index.html I have [dataset](https://github.com/zelima/climate-change) ready.
Could you please help with providing README.md for it. (few word about data itself, license and legal rights etc...)
You can view dataset here: http://data.okfn.org/tools/view?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzelima%2Fclimate-change (README missing for now)
