> EDGAR - Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research
>
> EDGAR is a multipurpose, independent, global database of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution on Earth. EDGAR provides independent emission estimates compared to what reported by European Member States or by Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), using international statistics and a consistent IPCC methodology.
>
> EDGAR provides both emissions as national totals and gridmaps at 0.1 x 0.1 degree resolution at global level, with yearly, monthly and up to hourly data.

Excellent source of data and graphs e.g. country profiles https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/country_profile
