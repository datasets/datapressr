# [meta] Set up waffle.io for this issue tracker

Would make it a lot easier to analyse status and progress of things.

What about using projects?

@sabas good suggestion and may use that rather than waffle for the moment.

Overall, having thought further, i don't think we necessarily need either atm so i'm going to close this as WONTFIX for now.

WONTFIX.
