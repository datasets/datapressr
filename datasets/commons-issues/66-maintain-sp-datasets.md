# Maintain S&P Datasets

We need a maintainer for these 2 S&P datasets. Maintainer means someone to run the scripts regularly:
- https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies [Update daily or weekly]
- https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500 - historical S&P data [monthly](may want renaming!)

I could also maintain these two.

@EnricGTorrents that would be great. Do you want to fork them now and try and do the regular update and then do a pull request. Especially on the S&P Companies you may need to sort some stuff by hand in my experience. Once we have done one we can merge it in.

### EnricGTorrents (2015-03-20T17:39:46Z)

Yes, it's better to merge once I am familiar with the process. Just sent an update on the Investor Flow of Funds package, later on today I will send you a pull request on these two.

@EnricGTorrents how is this going?

### rufuspollock (2015-04-26T21:31:40Z)

@EnricGTorrents how are you doing here?

### rufuspollock (2015-06-29T19:00:49Z)

@EnricGTorrents hey there - is this something you can take on - if not that's no problem but then we would look for someone else to act as maintainer for the time being :-)

Good day, in the spirit of contributing to open source I'd like to take up the task of maintaining the two datasets.

I think at least https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies is now getting regularly updated.

I think https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500 should be renamed to s-and-p-500-shiller or similar - but that needs a bit of thought.

And would be nice to get a S&P 500 financials dataset.
