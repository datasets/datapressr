> This Global Water Scarcity Atlas provides an introduction to water scarcity and showcases analyses that cover the whole world, based on cutting-edge research.
>
> Water scarcity means there is not enough water to go around. There is a need to reduce demand or increase supply - or someone loses out. Whatever happens, when water scarcity hits, the world cannot stay the same.

**Summary: heading for 2bn people in water scarcity**

## Data

https://waterscarcityatlas.org/data/water-scarcity-futures-tool/ - this seems to be main stuff behind the project and gives overview of the calculations. Links ...

* Downloaded data from explore page - CSV file with main computed time series variables. [watch-watergap-nat-decadal-2019-10-05T20_16_29.055Z.csv.txt](https://github.com/datopian/awesome-data/files/3693660/watch-watergap-nat-decadal-2019-10-05T20_16_29.055Z.csv.txt)
* Gitlab repo with lots of R code (no data afaict): https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/wdrg/wasco-data

## License

Data ??

Code is AGPL

## Research

Nice graphs on the front page - not obvious where to get  the source data.

After some digging around ... 

* https://waterscarcityatlas.org/research-data/data-and-code/ - not that useful in that it just has a list of data sources on other sites (some of which 404, most of which are another landing page)
* Main item from there: https://waterscarcityatlas.org/data/water-scarcity-futures-tool/ - this seems to be main stuff behind the project and gives overview of the calculations. Links ...
  * Gitlab repo with lots of R code (no data afaict): https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/wdrg/wasco-data
  * **Pay dirt**: visit the explore page (see below) and get the download
