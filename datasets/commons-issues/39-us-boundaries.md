i didn't get to it when i said i would...but i am getting bold now!

one question sir: are these federal us boundaries only? or state too?

### rufuspollock (2014-03-11T09:45:58Z)

I imagine you want the US subset of Admin 1 – States, Provinces http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/ Also I note there is also some topojson / geojson from mbostock for us i think - see #38

@jalbertbowden how's it going here?

### jalbertbowden (2015-02-23T01:54:30Z)

this and the countries one seem too easy. but i keep getting jvm.dll error when i run ogr2ogr commands in gdal. i'm either going to wipe this machine and start over or try on another box. i'll post something tonight or tomorrow

@jalbertbowden Any changes regarding this one?

### jalbertbowden (2016-08-09T01:40:57Z)

i'd apologize but clearly i have too much on my plate and continually let this group down.
please humor me, i generated geojson from shp for 110m (us boundaries). do i just update this repo? https://github.com/datasets/geo-boundaries-us-110m  
geojson is in this gist https://gist.github.com/jalbertbowden/419fda6ea36501145f7e392f4ccc4125

@jalbertbowden According to this comment:

think it'd be better to create new repo name "geo-boundaries-us-10m", that looks much like "geo-boundaries-us-100m" but with different data.

@zelima 👍 

@jalbertbowden first: good work. Second, don't feel you are letting folks down. You generously offer your time on this 😄  If you get busy with other stuff it happens 😉  The big thing to do is just let us know e.g. just say "Hey, I will get to this but probably in a few weeks as I'm super busy" or "I'm busy for quite a while and not sure when I'll get to this. If there is someone else who would like to take this on I can drop some notes quickly on how to do this".
