# Quality adjusted urban land prices time series

Urban land prices (price per sq m or per sq ft) for e.g. major cities over a reasonable span of time. Would like to quality adjust if possible (just for internal quality - not improvements in transportation or similar).

@Yannael do you want to see if we can rustle up someone to take this on?

@rgrp Yes, any suggestion where the data can be collected from?

@Yannael no, so first step would be research (aka googling) - no data wrangling needed!
