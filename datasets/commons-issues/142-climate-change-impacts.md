Climate Change Impacts on physical and biological systems

## The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports [AR4](http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/observed/) and [AR5](http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/observed_ar5/index.html) documented observed responses to climate change across a wide range of systems as well as regions.

**Changes in physical and biological systems and surface temperature 1970-2004**

Recent warming around the world has caused changes in many physical and biological systems. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report and Rosenzweig et al. (2008) documented observed responses to climate change across a wide range of systems as well as regions [1, 2]. In the database, responses in physical systems include shrinking glaciers in every continent, melting permafrost, shifts in spring peak river discharge associated with earlier snowmelt, lake and river warming (with effects on thermal stratification, chemistry, and freshwater organisms), and increases in coastal erosion. For terrestrial biological systems, changes documented in the database include shifts in spring events (e.g., earlier leaf unfolding, blooming date, migration, and timing of reproduction), species distributions, and community structure. Database observations also demonstrate changes in marine-ecosystem functioning and productivity, including shifts from cold-adapted to warm-adapted communities, phenological changes and alterations in species interactions. In each category, many of the data series are over 35 years in length.

**For the database, observations were selected that (1) demonstrate a statistically significant trend in change in either direction in systems related to temperature or other climate change variable as described by the authors; and (2) contain data for at least 20 years between 1970 and 2004 (although study periods may extend earlier or later). For each observation, the data series is described in terms of system, region, longitude and latitude, dates and duration, statistical significance, type of impact, and whether or not land use was identified as a driving factor. System changes are taken from ~80 studies (of which ~75 are new since the IPCC Third Assessment Report) containing >29,500 data series. Observations in the database are characterized as a ?change consistent with warming? or a ?change not consistent with warming,? based on information from the underlying studies.**

The locations of the observed physical and biological changes were overlaid on observed temperatures from 1970-2004 using two different gridded observed temperature data sets: HadCRUT3 [3] and GHCN-ERSST [4]. A spatial analysis showed that the agreement between the patterns of observed significant changes in natural systems and temperature change is very unlikely to be due to natural variability. Thus, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report and Rosenzweig et al. (2008) concluded that it is likely that anthropogenic warming has had a discernable influence on many physical and biological systems at a global scale.

@Snekili @rgrp I can start packing this one following this link http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/observed/data/IPCC_AR4_Observed_CC_Impacts_Database_v1.0.xls
I can map values with description provided in "Data fieldnames" sheet

### rufuspollock (2016-07-03T15:11:41Z)

@zelima can you give a sample / summary of what is in that database / spreadsheet. Also feel free to start a data package for this.

### zelima (2016-07-04T08:39:54Z)

@rgrp Spreadsheet contains three sheets - _data description_, _column name and data documentation_, and _data sheet_ itself. Original file looks something like this (I've omitted most of columns for better visualisation):

```
Year_pub,Ref,Ch_Reg,Lat,Long,SGNFCNT,Change,Air_T,SST,Prec
2003,Panuelas J. 2002,4,41.37,2.32,5,1,2,1,1
2002,Cook A.J. 2005,6,65.23,3.56,5,1,0,0,0
```

There are 20 columns total. All of the column names are defined on "documentation sheet" and all of the values are explained there. Meaning:

For example last column(Prec) in the example above is defined as **prescription** and its values _1_ and _0_ are defined as **yes** and **no**

This means that I can map column names and their values with their description, from documentation sheet and output file will directly contain e.g "yes" or "no" instead of unclear _1, 0_

### zelima (2016-07-04T08:53:17Z)

@rgrp @Snekili I've just discovered that I have ready datapackage for this one. I packaged it referring to https://github.com/datasets/registry/issues/146 this issue.

You can view repository here: https://github.com/zelima/climate-change
You can view data package here: http://data.okfn.org/tools/view?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzelima%2Fclimate-change

### rufuspollock (2016-08-09T10:03:05Z)

@zelima (and useful for @Snekili). If the data has documentation you need to add that to the description of each field in the schema (probably by hand but possibly automatically).

Also the README is very weak here and needs improving. Can you guys work on this together.

I'd also rename the data package to climate-change-impacts

/cc @rgieseke - who may be interested in these climate data packages too

### rgieseke (2016-08-09T11:38:51Z)

Nice work!
@zelima @rgrp Do you want to include other impact datasets as well in this data package? If not I would consider calling it "ipcc-ar4-climate-change-impacts" or "ipcc-climate-change-impacts".

### zelima (2016-08-09T15:12:57Z)

@rgrp updated `datapackage.json` with descriptions: https://github.com/zelima/climate-change-impacts/commit/f206eddaaf1ee0f8a1b94bb84778777ed49b30d0

@Snekili updated [README.md](https://github.com/zelima/climate-change-impacts/commit/1b41bcf178b42a57050f2b45784d99a750ef6fb5) please review it and help with improvements, e.g something is missing, or something is extra etc.. Also I could not find any Legal rights or Licenses page on their website. Maybe you know something.

@rgieseke I'm not competent enough in this case to "want to include" anything else in this data package. I would ask thoughts to @rgrp. Right now I renamed package to "climate-change-impacts"

Waiting for further comments, thanks for help all!

### rufuspollock (2016-08-11T07:08:59Z)

@rgieseke agree re naming though would usually have the qualifying provider at the end e.g. `climate-change-impacts-ipcc[-ar4]`.

@rgieseke do you have thoughts on what _would_ go into a generic climate-change-impacts package?

@zelima / @Snekili please report back once you have reviewed the README.

### rgieseke (2016-08-11T08:06:05Z)

> @rgieseke agree re naming though would usually have the qualifying provider at the end e.g. climate-change-impacts-ipcc[-ar4].

`climate-change-impacts-ipcc` is probably a good choice then. There is also one from the AR5 report: http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/observed_ar5/index.html
Though there is no spreadsheet available:
"A downloadable spreadsheet of the table contents and references is in preparation."

> @rgieseke do you have thoughts on what would go into a generic climate-change-impacts package?

Not sure whether it would make sense to have one generic package as there are potentially quite many sectors and studies. A project providing
"a framework for consistently projecting the impacts of climate change across affected sectors and spatial scales" is the [ISIMIP](https://www.isimip.org/) project.

### Snekili (2016-08-11T08:29:23Z)

@zelima @rgrp Updated README for AR4. 
As for licence, I can't find it ether, but found this on page:

### rufuspollock (2016-09-13T08:17:21Z)

@rgieseke this is great. Do you have a README or other documentation writing up some of your learning here - you clearly have done a lot of digging :-)

### rufuspollock (2016-09-13T08:17:54Z)

@zelima can we rename the package as per suggestions (when you get a moment!)

### zelima (2016-09-14T16:05:34Z)

@all sorry for late respond.
- Renamed the package to `climate-change-impacts-ipcc-ar4` since Github does not allow square brackets `[]`https://github.com/zelima/climate-change-impacts-ipcc-ar4
- @Snekili Updated license part: https://github.com/zelima/climate-change-impacts-ipcc-ar4/commit/ff34b1663b1a155d7dc20f4a8a3134349df78e9b
