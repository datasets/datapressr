# List of all public health insurances in Germany with contact details

There is no open repository of contact details for health insurances in Germany apart from one PDF listing URLs. Assisted by web scraping we have compiled a complete list with email, address and telephone number. This should be helpful for healthcare system researchers trying to access policies or data from all insurances. There are 137 of them! Does this belong in the registry?

@mattfullerton I think this certainly belongs in datasets so please donate if you have it

Whether it makes it into the top-level data.okfn.org/data not sure yet, would have to think :-)

It doesn't look to me like it belongs in the main registry, but in any case it's here now:
