# [meta] Only track core datasets (remove catalog-list)

What: remove catalog-list.csv

Why?

* catalog-list is now very out of date - there are many other data packages out there
* the scraping system for getting this list from github is pretty poor (and by getting rid of catalog-list we can get rid of that too)
