# Top 1 million websites in the world (Majestic Million)

https://blog.majestic.com/development/majestic-million-csv-daily/

> The Majestic Million is a list of the top 1 million website in the world, ordered by the number of referring subnets. A subnet is a bit complex – but to a layman it is basically anything within an IP range, ignoring the last three digits of the IP number.
