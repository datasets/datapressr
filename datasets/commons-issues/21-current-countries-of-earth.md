# current countries of earth

I had a python script kicking around for fetching up-to-date country code standards and putting them all together.

I love the work you are doing on dataprotocols.org so I reorganized it as a datapackage.
This probably duplicates some of the data already included in the registry, so feel free to ignore.

@ewheeler this is **fantastic** and is much more extensive than current iso country codes package at https://github.com/datasets/country-codes.

Would you be up for having this as an "official" data.okfn.org dataset (perhaps with a small name tweak e.g. country-codes-full or country-codes-comprehensive (bit of a mouthfull!))

### ewheeler (2013-06-05T14:44:40Z)

@rgrp great! i'm happy to maintain it as an "official" dataset.

i agree something like country-codes-comprehensive is more precise.

what are the next steps? shall i change my repo name and the metadata?

### rufuspollock (2013-06-07T17:56:37Z)

Yes, if you're happy, pls go ahead and change the repo name and metadata.

Also would you be happy to have the repo live under github.com/datasets org (we'd make you an owner of the org so you could maintain this :-) ). If that's a prob happy to just maintain a fork and do regular pulls ...

### rufuspollock (2013-06-14T19:51:44Z)

@ewheeler let me know how this going - would love to get this included!

### ewheeler (2013-06-17T15:41:02Z)

@rgrp sorry for the delay! i've made the repo name and metadata changes:
https://github.com/ewheeler/country-codes-comprehensive

i'd be happy to move it to github.com/datasets and maintain it there

### rufuspollock (2013-06-18T17:57:57Z)

@ewheeler I've made you an owner so you should be able to move the repo across :-)

### ewheeler (2013-06-19T13:30:36Z)

@rgrp awesome thanks. repo has been transferred to datasets!
