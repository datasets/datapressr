@rgrp 

This is sugested best data source from 
[National hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/dcmi.shtml)
Here you can find PDF and MS-word, I think only doc that I've fond and that is no to broad and it has excellent data in it, maybe we could extract the facts into CSV?

Then NHC has database but like this 
[Hurricanes in History](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/outreach/history/)
This is nice database but you must filter each individual hurricane

@rgrp And this one?

@Snekili 
- I'm not really clear where I can find good clean data -  the first one you cite has PDF / MS-Word which does not sound promising
- Could "Other potential datasets" be a bulleted list - it would be more readable
- In general this sounds like a dataset we should de-prioritize as there is no immediately available good dataset in a good open form

Also, on this one I'm not really clear of the relationship to climate change stuff. Is this supposed to be an indicator of impact? Would it be more useful to have extreme events around the world? (I'm just asking btw: I don't really know about this area -- I also think impacts are probably less important than the direct effects stuff).
