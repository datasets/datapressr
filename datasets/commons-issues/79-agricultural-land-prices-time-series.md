# Agricultural land prices time series

Want agricultural land prices over time (for as long as possible) in major agricultural areas.

In terms of areas we could start with easy ones in terms of data availability (e.g. US midwest, UK) and move on to others e.g. Russia / Ukraine cornbelt, Australia, China, India etc etc.
