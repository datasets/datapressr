To register with swift.com you need to work for an institution that already has a BIC it would seem, and that institution needs to authorise your account.  There are a number of websites that list swift codes but none of them are official. We could cross reference them I guess, but I'd rather the data came from official sources.

@PilipMac if we can't get an official source we perhaps need to start with an unofficial source ...

Okay, I can do that for BIC codes. I'll get going on the IBAN's as well. I've an IBAN question though, as they are bank account numbers is there a data protection issue attached to them? Or are they already in the public domain.

@PilipMac - re IBAN we're not looking for full IBAN but the IBAN "prefix" for the bank I think.

@rgrp Okay. I'm researching data sources this week. Started a new job which delayed things but I'm back working on it now.

@PilipMac how did you get on with this? Did you find any sources?
