# [meta] Index of sources

I had the idea of having a list somewhere posted to be used as a resource that would include all main sources of information. An example would be:

**International**
- [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/)
- [CIA Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/)
- ..

**European**
- [Eurobarometer](http://ec.europa.eu/health/reports/eurobarometer/index_en.htm)
- ..

**Portuguese**
- [Instituto Nacional de Estatística](https://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpgid=ine_main&xpid=INE)
- ..

**England**
- ..

This would require to be community-driven, in a sense that we cannot find every country's sources and the list might be huge. I am expecting that every local group would willingly add their inputs to this list.

What are your thoughts?

Awesome stuff, @scls19fr!!

I was not aiming specific for JSON databases, but those help too, considering they're mostly official databases in many countries.
That gave me the idea of separating those that support JSON and those that don't.

@rgrp Do we have any sort of index of official sources of information somewhere?

@gsilvapt what do you mean? There is http://dataportals.org/ but I'm not sure what you mean. There are a lot of different official sources. Personally whilst nice to have i would not prioritise this issue atm.

### gsilvapt (2016-05-07T18:15:45Z)

@rgrp In almost every country, there are official sources of data - e.g. National Institute of Statistics (INE) in Portugal. I assume there are others in other countries. 

In other words, this would help people search for data in the most credible sources of information there are out there. Data Portals might be it, if it also contains official sources and not only open sources.

### rufuspollock (2016-05-08T14:49:38Z)

@gsilvapt in general i don't think is probably the place for it - if we did want it somewhere i suggest adding it to dataportal and you can open an issue there https://github.com/okfn/dataportals.org
