@yetzt that's right - its a stub email for github to use. If you want to contact us post here: https://discuss.okfn.org/c/open-knowledge-labs/core-datasets

And yes, i guess we could set up an auto-responder telling you that ;-)

you could also decide to not display a public email adress

@yetzt good suggestions and fixed :-) (I think we had it public initially because it gives you the gravatar).
