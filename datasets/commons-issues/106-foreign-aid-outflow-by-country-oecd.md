@mcnabber091 another great one to package. Definitely worth doing. Do you want to start on this? Do you have any questions?

### mcnabber091 (2015-08-01T23:01:08Z)

I will start on this package later this weekend. I don't have any questions right now.

@mcnabber091 Have you gotten anywhere? This data looks really useful, I often see news referring to this type of numbers.

Sorry I havn't had time to work on this. @pdehaye Would you I be interested to work on this one? Honestly I am not very good with Github.

@mcnabber091 as explained you can prep this in google docs or similar and someone else can get into github. If you do have this nicely cleaned somewhere that's still really useful.

I don't know where to find this data in csv format. For econfactbook I manually got the data from: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/data.htm and http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/country-profiles

More particularly the data is [here](http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/data-guides/datastore)

To interact with OECD's database, [the official API guide might become handy](https://data.oecd.org/api/).
