@sabas like it ...

I drafted the package with the supporting data and the codes from the first chapter (out of 97) manually extracted from the PDFs.

@pdehaye could you review @sabas work and see if it is ready for core?

### sabas (2016-12-28T15:15:39Z)

Please only consider the structure, the main data is only from a sample chapter, and one row is not quoted

EDIT: Fixed and added the second chapter (out of 97)

@rgrp, I am trying to focus a bit my efforts for 2017 (towards personal
data stuff). Is this a one shot, or will there be follow ups? If the latter
it makes more sense for someone else to do it. Thanks!

@pdehaye this is a one-shot so if you could look that would be great.

regarding being managing curator: I hear you that you would like to hand the baton on ...

@rufuspollock I found a data source and completed the dataset
https://github.com/sabas/harmonized-system
I think it could be moved to the datasets org.

### rufuspollock (2020-02-21T02:25:15Z)

@sabas awesome! @monikappv can you help coordinate this with @sabas

### monikappv (2020-02-28T08:45:05Z)

@sabas hey, looks like you are a member of the datasets org - you can move the dataset directly to a new repo there.. let me know if / how I can help.

### sabas (2020-02-28T13:59:42Z)

@monikappv done! Please have a look if that's ok
