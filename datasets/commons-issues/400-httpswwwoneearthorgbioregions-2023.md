# https://www.oneearth.org/bioregions-2023/

We’ve grown accustomed to seeing the world divided into countries, states, and provinces, but there is another way to see and better understand the planet we call home. One Earth presents a novel biogeographical framework called Bioregions 2023, which delineates 185 discrete bioregions organized within the world's major biogeographical realms. The bioregions and the [iconic species](https://www.oneearth.org/category/iconic-species/) associated with each can be explored through One Earth’s [Interactive Navigator.](https://www.oneearth.org/navigator/?view=bioregions)
