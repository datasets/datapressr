# Economic History

* http://www.macrohistory.net/data/ - The database covers 17 advanced economies since 1870 on an annual basis. It comprises 25 real and nominal variables. Among these, there are time series that had been hitherto unavailable to researchers, among them financial variables such as bank credit to the non-financial private sector, mortgage lending and long-term house prices. The database captures the near-universe of advanced-country macroeconomic and asset price dynamics, covering on average over 90 percent of advanced-economy output and over 50 percent of world output.

I have just created the data package as part of my onboarding process and uploaded it to datahub https://datahub.io/edvardmk/economic-history-data-package/v/3

@edvardmk 👏 👏  Couple of things:

* Can you link the github repo for this - that's actually the most crucial part as it has the script etc
* Can you move this in the project board to the right location (see projects at the right) - or maybe you can't do that ... (permissions?)
