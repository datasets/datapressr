# Working Hours Time Series (Historical)

Good set of tables in Huberman and Minns (2007): *The times they are not changin’: Days and hours of work in Old and New Worlds, 1870–2000*

More recent cross-national time series can probably be found from ILO or national statistical agencies.

See also Voth (1998)  *Time and Work in Eighteenth-Century London* for evidence on work hours in London between 1750 and 1800 https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/economics/history/paper21/21voth.pdf
