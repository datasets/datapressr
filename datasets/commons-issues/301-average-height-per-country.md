Hi @anuveyatsu I have completed the task. The dataset contains average height information that is sometimes reported separately for Rural and Urban populations within the same country. This is because living conditions, nutrition, healthcare access, and socioeconomic factors often differ significantly between rural and urban areas, which can influence average human growth patterns. For example, people in urban areas may generally have better access to healthcare and more diverse diets, which can lead to taller average heights compared to rural populations.

The “Both” category is used when the reported data represents the overall national average across both rural and urban populations, or when the study combined male and female data into a single value. This ensures comparability when country-level averages are needed without breaking down into subgroups.
Countries may appear more than once in the dataset for several reasons:

- Different Years – Height studies are conducted in different years, and average heights can change over time due to improvements in nutrition, lifestyle, or other factors. For example, you may see entries for Germany in both 2010 and 2021.

- Different Sex Categories – Many studies report results separately for Male, Female, and Both groups, leading to multiple entries for the same country and year.

- Regional or Subpopulation Data – In some cases, specific regions or subgroups (e.g., Brazil – Rural, Brazil – Urban, Lithuania – Urban, Lithuania – Rural) have separate measurements in addition to a national-level “Both”.
Multiple Sources – A few countries may have more than one entry for the same year and sex because different research studies or surveys reported slightly different values. These are included for completeness and transparency.

@Dawit-1621 where did the data come from?
