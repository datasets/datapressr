# Create template repository with best practices

From https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data/discussions/377#discussioncomment-5302929, having a `dataset-template` with a standard basic setup e.g. makefile, docker image, datapackage.json (?), README etc, can make things easier to maintain and reduce friction when starting a new project.
