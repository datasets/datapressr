# Global Religious Futures Project

The Future of World Religions - Explore the rapidly changing religious profile of the world through 2050

http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/explorer/about-GRF-data

> The Global Religious Futures project is based on data obtained using a range of social science methods, including public opinion surveys, demographic analysis and coding. The Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life project has conducted public opinion surveys in more than 40 countries, completed demographic analyses that cover 234 countries and territories, and coded 198 countries and territories for government restrictions on religion and social hostilities involving religion. Additional data sources – such as the United Nations – are cited where used.

## Data

Really hard to find in the shiny front end ...

You can generate CSVs and you get URLs like ...

http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/csv/9359/preview

But no logic to these and now way to generate these except via UI afaict. No bulk download.

Have one big table here ... https://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projection-table/2010/percent/all/

This is relatively scrapable ... and OWID has done that - see
