# Medicare Drug Spending Data

This is interesting in context of looking at what US gov spends on medicines.

https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Information-on-Prescription-Drugs/2015MedicareData.html

The 2015 Medicare drug spending data files present drug spending and utilization information on Medicare Part B drugs (drugs administered in doctors’ offices and other outpatient settings) and Medicare Part D drugs (drugs patients generally administer themselves). These data files are the basis for the 2015 Medicare Drug Spending Dashboard and include annual data for 2011 to 2015.

CMS is prohibited from publicly disclosing drug-specific information on manufacturer rebates, thus Part D drug spending metrics do not reflect any manufacturers’ rebates or other price concessions.  For additional information on the aggregation methodologies and variables included in the data files, please see the “Methods” and “Variables” worksheets available in each Excel workbook.
