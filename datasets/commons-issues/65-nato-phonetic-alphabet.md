# NATO phonetic alphabet

The wiki article itself lists multiple sources : US Army, ICAO, FAA etc. Probably all could be imported from original sources and combined into one. I am assuming they are accurate due to their importance.

@sanh2o I suggest we pick the default / main one and just go with that (if we can work that out). Simplicity is king!

There are atleast 4 different standards with slightly different pronunciations , probably combine all into 1 ? The thing is i can simply get the data from wiki and add links to original sources in case standards change , which may not happen overnight.

@sanh2o do we have a sense of the most standard? I'd also do the simplest thing possible to get started - we can always add more later. So I'd just pick whatever is easiest to get or you think is most important and get that in and we get it up. We can then add more of the variations later.

@rgrp Ok, looks like at least 2 standards are more important than others , i will add it first in a package form.

@sanh2o how are you doing here?

### sanh2o (2015-05-01T18:53:40Z)

@rgrp, almost ready. Trying to resolve a data validation error.

@sanh2o how are you doing here? Would love to get this in :-)
