# Political Ad Transparency at Facebook, Google etc

## Google

https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/home - full data

CSV https://storage.googleapis.com/transparencyreport/google-political-ads-transparency-bundle.zip

### Facebook

https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/

NO bulk download!

And this ...

> In order to use the API, you need to gain access to the Facebook Ads Library API at https://www.facebook.com/ID and confirm your identity for Running Ads About Social Issues, Elections or Politics, which involves receiving a letter w/ a code at your US address and sending picture identification to Facebook. [via https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-ad-library-scraper]

### Aggregation: 2019 EU Elections

Mozilla did collection https://adtransparency.mozilla.org/eu/

Not sure how to download the data in bulk though.

Very interesting log of the pain points in scraping Facebook API (which was very broken): https://adtransparency.mozilla.org/eu/log/
