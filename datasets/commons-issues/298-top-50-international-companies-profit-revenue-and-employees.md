Hey @geoffrey1330 this one also has been moved to "Published" pipeline which means somebody already did work but we may need to move the dataset to GitHub.

Appreciate your willingness to contribute @geoffrey1330 🙏 

I would suggest looking into this board and you can take any issue from the "Ready to go" pipeline. Some items in "Preparing and packaging" might also be available to work on as they might have been left unfinished.
