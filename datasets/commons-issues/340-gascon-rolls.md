# Gascon Rolls

http://www.gasconrolls.org/en/

> The Gascon Rolls 1317-1467 For much of the later Middle Ages, south-western France (Aquitaine) was under English rule. Every year from 1273 a ‘Gascon roll’ was drawn up by the English royal administration, recording a wide range of business and mentioning many people and places. The rolls were continued until 1467 even though the area was lost by the English in 1453. The Gascon rolls are to be found today in The National Archives at Kew in C 61. This site contains calendars of all of the rolls from 1317 (TNA C 61/72) to 1467 ( to C 61/144). (Printed calendars of the rolls before 1317 were published between 1900 and 1950.) Alongside the  online calendars you will find digital images of the rolls provided by The National Archives (TNA). We also provide introductions to each roll as well as scholarly apparatus, indexes and a search engine.
