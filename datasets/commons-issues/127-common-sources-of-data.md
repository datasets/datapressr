# Common sources of data

It could be useful to maintain a list of sources of data, and URLs to these sources: OECD, UN, ISO, etc. 
(this might also be extractable from the registry itself). 

But maybe this already exists somewhere?

@pdehaye good idea. Does not yet exist afaik.

A quick dump of my notes so far, to be organised later
- OECD
- ISO
-  http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/dnllist.asp
- http://stats.oecd.org/
- http://www.finra.org/industry/trace/corporate-bond-data
- http://www.datahub.io/dataset
- http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/
- http://www.jodidata.org/database/access-database.aspx

Quick note: maybe the best way about this is to look at the registry and the source files of the data packages in there.
